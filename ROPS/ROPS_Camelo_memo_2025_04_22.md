General:

Delivery vertical: We continue working on reducing times and improving SLAs. In the last three weeks, the percentage of orders delivered over 50 minutes was 29% in week 9, 31% in week 10, and 17% in week 11, with 3,733 orders in week 9, 3,217 orders in week 10, and 2,257 orders in week 11 due to spring break.
We continue performing QA on order data and have made important findings that led to immediate operational adjustments, significantly improving SLA times.
We continue projecting a 25% reduction in contractor costs. Although spring break has helped and demand has decreased by approximately 200 orders, the daily volume remains between 400 and 480 orders.
Regarding other verticals: We have managed more than 6 events over the past two weeks in different time zones, including the US and London, with overall positive performance.
